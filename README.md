# Grahmn-Scan
This program will implement Graham’s scan that computes the convex hull of a set of points in the two-dimensionalspace.  The convex hull is the smallest convex set that contains the data set.  For simplicity, we assume nothree points in the data set are colinear

There are a few steps I took to do this that Include.

Step 1: Find the First Point on the Hull

Step 2: Sorting the Other Points by Polar Angle in place 

Step 3: implement Graham’s Scan algorithm which will scan the other points in increasing polar angle
